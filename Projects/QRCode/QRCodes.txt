History: The barcode is just an extention of morsecode.
There are pairs of lines that split the barcode up. Manufacture info on the left. Product info on the right.
The last final digit is a checksum if one of the number of the barcode has been damaged.

However the limit of data in a barcode forced a different solution. Taking inspiration from a go board, you can store information in 2d.
it turns a website url into ASCCII characters in binary.

3-4 squares are used to alighned and orient the QR code. Then the data is filled in via zigzag patern. Only half the space is filled in while the rest
is done for redundancy. 1/3 of the code can be missing for it to stil work. This is done with error correcting binary that is found on lots of other media.
